A great project idea for ASP.NET MVC that allows adding multiple features over time is **"Task Management System"**.  

### **Project Name:** TaskFlow - A Task Management System  

### **Core Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)**  
1. **User Authentication & Authorization**  
   - Login, Register, Role-based access (Admin, Manager, Employee).  

2. **Task Creation & Assignment**  
   - Users can create tasks, assign them to specific team members.  

3. **Task Status Tracking**  
   - Task statuses: To Do, In Progress, Completed.  
   - Users can update the status of their tasks.  

4. **Dashboard & Reports**  
   - Overview of pending, completed, and ongoing tasks.  

### **Future Feature Additions**  
Once the core is built, you can incrementally add:  
âœ… **File Attachments** â€“ Upload files related to tasks.  
âœ… **Commenting System** â€“ Users can discuss within tasks.  
âœ… **Priority Levels** â€“ High, Medium, Low task priority.

âœ… **REST API** â€“ Expose APIs for mobile or frontend apps.  
âœ… **Multi-Tenancy** â€“ Allow different organizations to use the system.  

### **Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** Razor Views, Bootstrap  
- **Backend:** ASP.NET MVC, C#  
- **Database:** MS SQL Server  
- **Authentication:** Identity Framework  
- **Additional Tools:** jQuery, AJAX, Entity Framework  

This project keeps growing over time, allowing you to practice various features progressively. Would you like me to guide you on setting up the basic structure? ðŸš€
